1 more data dive , and quiz

Next week - Project talk, just spending time snd figuring doubts

PROJECT -
writeup : 
similar to each weeks data dive, code, visulaiztion, insights etc etc

figure out what can interest 


presentation : Record with face, 

2 things to submit

=================================

Translating business terms to stats - 
----------
case 1: Ask questions, by going through conversations (along with EDA), to better understand the data.

case 2: Business is particularly interested in something,
 -  Attempt to answer it with EDA
 -  Propose a stst analysis and iterate on the idea (like do A/B test for the data done 1 year back, to )

Things to do :
1. Set a scope (what to include / exclude): variables to take or not , tests/models to run
   (what data we are going to use? and what )
2. Set a success criteria : define ahead of time, what needs to be done? 
   eg: valid interpretation then can we move on ? without which
3. Plan for use : How will the results be implemented? (manage risks)
4. Open up your questions to criticism, and iterate

(* if our opinion and findings are not what the superior says -
   A: listen to superior as they have communication to stakeholders and other superiors.
   B: you are the expert as the data is with you, talk to other teams like marketing and stuff to understand better to retalk about the ideas.
)




Data storytelling - 
---------
like say we have a question -> business related , so we evaluate it and got to communicate our work.



1. Define a scope : ignore data which is unrelated to the project, provide justification of why we are not including it.

Is it difficult to build a sentence with the data and topic?
(eg -player stats is the need of the hour.  dont go question : how the player make money based on merchandise ? then only take it and neglect rest)

dont go searching which is not  required.

Key points - MORE SALIENT AND AUDIENCE (so less distracted)

[EXAMPLE - Find houses without basements (price), how to pick variables??
 -> Find targets (sales_rpice) and try finding correlation between the other variables and pick those.  
 -> To confirm on those, speak with colleagues to undertsnad if the variables we picked is workable.
]

2. Filter signal (relation/ standing out) from the Noise : 
Signals (detected during EDA) 
- strong correlations 
- skewed distributions 
- intutitive hypothesis with substanticial evidence against them.

Weak signals - scattered plot, then they state there is no proper relation between the variables. 
couple of data that stand out/outliers (if they are not intuitive , can be looked into later).

(when checking a data, draw histogram - to understand if right skewed? if outliers are there? what can be told about the neighbourhood)

3. Consider the sudience
-  who will this story be shared to? 
(team of analysts? )
helps in finding evidence and try to challenge their current workk

- how to present the story?
  Tech vs general layman terms
  Extremely in depth oe focused on useful parts
  stats aspects vs strategic concerns of the company

- consider the audience
  Can say abt clear variables based on their background.
  report shouldnt be there direct in the presentation. 


4. Identify effective Data Visualization :
  Such that they are effective.
  Build visualization to communicate a single message.
  (avoid the clutter by dividing the data to sections if they are separate clusters)
  Title is important, so add that to explain the visualization
  Be clear 
  remove background grey if its unnecessary

	
5. Provide Context :
  Present situation and purpose before presenting findings
  Link all findings to the situation and purpose.
(all insights should be tied to a result that can bring about actions in the future)

6. Structure your story like a story :
  ***** This is what we need to look into while speaking about it in the clas/work *****
	1. Introduction - set the stage
	2. Rising action - build tension, introduce conflict.
	3. Climax - provide a crucial moment or insight (Main Inisght)
	4. Falling action -  resolve conflicts
	5. Denouncemnt - final resolution and retrospection

7. Edit your story: 

  Get feedback from audience.
  Expect something to be unclear
  welcome criticism


Communication Best Practices -
-------
1. gauge individuals technical expertise : clarify based on vocab
   invite questions
consider preferances and sensitives like atmosphere, attitude, and directness

2. Focus on the client, not the concepts: (dont put p-value if not everyone is aware of it.)

(Euclids - book of elements)
3. Open yourself to feedback


4. Plan for contngencies
  structure the converstaion/presentation
  anticipate questions

5. Be humble, but confident
